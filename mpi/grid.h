   the current values, and one to write the results into when we are updating the grid. Hence the
   grid has 4 dimensions not 3, the last dimension being the two versions of the grid. We swap between
   the two versions as we go from iteration to iteration, the current member of the derived type
   indicating which version is the most up to date.*/
